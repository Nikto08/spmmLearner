Implementation of Active Automata Learning algorithm for Systems of Procedural Mealy-Machines

## About
   This library is developed for creating models of Software, that can be (approximately) represented
   as a System of Procedural Mealy-Machines.

## Installation Guide

* #### Java 8 & Maven
  The tool requires a working [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) & [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installation.
  It is suggested to use one of the major Java IDEs which should already have out-of-the-box support for Maven projects.

* #### GraphViz
  For visualizing the automata, [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is required.
